Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenThe study found two years of war had led to ‘enormous nutritional consequences’ for tens of thousands of children across Gaza. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\n# Almost 55,000 preschool children in Gaza acutely malnourished, Lancet study estimates\n\nStudy shows clear link between Israeli aid restrictions and malnutrition among children aged between six months and five years\n\n- Gaza ceasefire plan live – latest updates\n\nAlmost 55,000 children under the age of six in Gaza are estimated to be acutely malnourished, far more than have so far been identified as victims of the potentially lethal condition, a study published in the Lancet, the respected international medical periodical, has revealed.The study, published on Wednesday, and led by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), offers a month-by-month breakdown through much of the two-year conflict, and shows for the first time a clear link between Israeli restrictions on supplies entering Gaza and levels of malnutrition among children.Almost 55,000 children could be malnourished in GazaIsrael has repeatedly denied blame for any hunger in Gaza, saying that it allows adequate food into the territory and claiming that the humanitarian agencies there are ineffective.The research comes amid cautious optimism that indirect talks between Hamas and Israel under way in Egypt could lead to an end to the war.Young lives cut short on an unimaginable scale: the 18,457 children on Gaza’s list of war deadRead moreThe 21-point plan under discussion in Sharm el-Sheik, the Red Sea resort, was announced last week by Donald Trump. It calls for a ceasefire, the return of hostages still held by Hamas and a surge of aid into Gaza “without interference … through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent”.Dr Akihiro Seita, the Unrwa director of health and an author of the study, said more malnourished children would die unless there was an end to hostilities and “unimpeded, competent, international humanitarian nutritional, medical, economic and social services”.The study found two years of war had led to “enormous nutritional consequences” for tens of thousands of children across Gaza.Researchers used measurements of the circumference of the arms of 220,000 children aged between six months and five years old in Gaza between January 2024, and August 2025, when famine was declared in parts of Gaza by a UN-backed panel of independent experts.In January 2024, 5% of children screened showed evidence of wasting, rising to nearly 9% six months later, researchers found. After Israel imposed severe aid restrictions from the end of 2024, the prevalence of wasting had almost doubled by January 2025.When a six-week ceasefire allowed more aid to enter Gaza, wasting declined significantly before Israel imposed a tight 11-week blockade in March. Though these restrictions were eased in May 2025, levels of wasting among screened children soared to nearly 16%, with almost a quarter of these suffering severe acute malnutrition, the most dangerous form of the condition.Among the estimated total population of Gaza, this is equivalent to more than 54,600 children up to six years old who need emergency nutrition and medical care, including 12,800 severely wasted children, the researchers said.Israel has accused Hamas of looting much of the aid reaching Gaza, but has not provided evidence of any significant amount of theft by the Islamist militant organisation. Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls the entry of aid into Gaza, also accused Hamas of deliberately preventing civilians accessing aid by firing rockets at aid distribution sites.View image in fullscreenPalestinians, including children, wait with pots to receive hot meals distributed by charity organisations on 25 September. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBetween May and July, more than 1,400 Palestinians were killed seeking humanitarian assistance in Gaza, 859 in the vicinity of sites run by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and 514 along the routes of food convoys, according to the UN, which said that most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.Aid agencies say Israeli restrictions prevent much of the aid getting into Gaza, and conditions created by the war and Israeli strategic decisions have made it almost impossible for them to operate.Dr Masako Horino, nutrition epidemiologist at Unrwa and lead scientist for the study, said that evidence from before the war indicated that children in Palestinian refugee families in the Gaza Strip were already “food insecure” but were only marginally underweight.“Following two years of war and severe restrictions in humanitarian aid, tens of thousands of preschool aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from preventable acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of mortality,” Horino said.Leading child health experts and paediatricians said the study was particularly “notable and important” because it was the first major medical study to reveal the extent of malnutrition among children in Gaza after two years of war.Writing in a comment piece in the Lancet, Zulfiqar Bhutta, Jessica Fanzo, and Paul Wise, who were not involved in the research, said: “It is now well established that the children of Gaza are starving and require immediate and sustained humanitarian assistance. The study by Horino and colleagues provides some of the most definitive evidence to date of this effect.”Bhutta, of the Hospital for Sick Children in Canada, Fanzo, of Columbia University and Wise, of Stanford University, also praised the researchers for using scientific evidence “to show grievous, preventable harm to children”.“These temporal data strongly suggest that restrictions on food and assistance have resulted in severe malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip, a reality that will undoubtedly impact their future health and development outcomes for generations.”Although attention has mostly focused on the short-term outcomes of starvation, there should also be “serious concern” over its long-term health effects, which included “inordinately high risks of non-communicable diseases”, they added.On Tuesday, Cogat said it “continues to support international organisations facilitating food delivery and production for Gaza’s civilian population”.The study found that in Rafah, the southern city in Gaza, there was a fourfold increase in wasting malnutrition after Israel launched a massive offensive into the city and levelled it. There was then a sharp decline in April 2025 after the short-lived ceasefire.In Gaza City, prevalence of wasting malnutrition rose more than fivefold from March 2025, reaching almost 30% in mid-August 2025.James Elder, a spokesperson for Unicef, said last week that there was “a lot of panic, a lot of very hungry people” in Gaza City.“It is very difficult to describe the levels of desperation there. There are tens of thousands of children. About two-thirds of people just can’t leave. There are pregnant women eating a meal a day. More aid trucks are coming in but it is a fraction of what we need,” Elder said.Unrwa, which was founded in 1949 to provide essential services for Palestinian refugees who had fled or been expelled during the wars surrounding the foundation of Israel, has been accused by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, of being “perforated by Hamas” and banned by Israel. Unrwa denied the allegations and was cleared by UN investigators.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n- [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza) - [Palestine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories) - [Middle East and north Africa](https://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast) - [Malnutrition](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/malnutrition) - [Israel-Gaza war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war) - [Children](https://www.theguardian.com/society/children) - [news](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news)\n\nShareReuse this content\n\nMore on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n- LiveGaza ceasefire plan live: Israel says it is preparing to pull back troops; living hostages could be released within days - Gaza ceasefire deal: what has been agreed for ‘first phase’ and why now? - ‘First phase’ of ceasefire deal to end war in Gaza agreed by Israel and Hamas - Tears of joy and celebratory gunfire: how Gaza and Israel reacted to news of ceasefire deal - Republican lawmakers praise Trump for Gaza deal as Palestinian Americans remain wary: ‘So much remains unclear’ - Trump says Gaza peace deal ‘very close’ and he may travel to Middle East in days - Why Tony Blair just can’t kick the habit of imperial interference in the Middle East - Young lives cut short on an unimaginable scale: the 18,457 children on Gaza’s list of war dead - ‘It broke the entire family apart’: Israel’s 7 October trauma remains plain to see - Diplomacy’s lowest point: how the Israel-Gaza conflict was mishandled\n\nMost viewed\n\n## Most viewed",

      "content": "Image source, EPAImage caption, The talks seek to end the devastating war in Gaza which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians\n\nByRushdi Abualouf, Gaza correspondent, Reporting fromIstanbul and David Gritten\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he has been informed \"we are very close to a deal\" to end the war in Gaza, after officials reported progress after a third day of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Egypt.A Palestinian official told the BBC that Egyptian, Qatari and Turkish mediators finished seven hours of talks with the Hamas delegation, which included members of other Palestinian groups.Mediators are meeting Israel's delegation to seek final answers on remaining issues.Wednesday's talks focused on the first phase of a US peace plan that includes a ceasefire, the release of all hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and Israel's withdrawal from parts of Gaza.\n\nAt an unrelated event at the White House on Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio entered and passed Trump a note, which appeared to ask that Trump approve a Truth Social post about Gaza so that \"you can announce first\".Trump said that note informed him that \"we are very close to a deal\".He exited the room shortly thereafter, saying he had to focus on the Middle East.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is considering going to the region on Friday.According to the Palestinian official, there has been good progress on the prisoner-exchange lists and on guarantees to prevent a return to fighting.Hamas agreed to release all Israeli hostages, while delaying the handover of bodies until field conditions allow.The Sharm el-Sheikh talks on a 20-point peace plan proposed by Trump are being described as the most significant since the war began.\n\nMedia caption, Watch: Trump says Middle East deal ‘very close’ after being passed note by Marco Rubio\n\nTrump's envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived to the talks in Egypt on Wednesday along with Qatar's prime minister and Turkey's intelligence chief, seeking to bridge the gaps that could derail a breakthrough.\n\nA senior Hamas official told the BBC on Wednesday morning that it had shown \"the necessary positivity\" in the negotiations and submitted a list of the prisoners it wants Israel to release in exchange for the 48 hostages still held in Gaza, up to 20 of whom are still alive.\n\nIsraeli media cited officials as expressing optimism for a deal.\n\nIsrael's Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reportedly arrived in the afternoon to lead the Israeli delegation.\n\nTrump previously said the US would do \"everything possible to make sure everyone adheres to the deal\" if Hamas and Israel could agree one.\n\nIt is hoped the presence of heavyweight negotiators will add to the momentum for a deal.\n\nEgypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi called the arrival of Witkoff and Kushner \"very encouraging\", saying they came \"with a strong will, a strong message, and a strong mandate from President Trump to end the war in this round of negotiations\".\n\nKushner previously served as Trump's Middle East adviser during his first term.\n\n- Inside one battle-scarred Gaza building, displaced families tell the story of the war - Jeremy Bowen: Two years on, will Israel and Hamas seize the chance to end the war? - What are the key sticking points in Trump's Gaza peace plan? - Read the full 20-point peace plan\n\nRepresentatives from two other Palestinian armed groups, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), were also present at talks.\n\nTheir involvement appeared to be an attempt by Hamas to keep them in line and secure the release of the hostages they are believed to be holding.\n\nThe list of prisoners Hamas wants released by Israel includes several of the most prominent Palestinians in Israeli jails, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat.\n\nBarghouti, who is seen as a potential successor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted in 2004 of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed.\n\nSaadat, the leader of the PLFP, was sentenced to 30 years after being convicted in 2008 of heading an \"illegal terrorist organisation\" and involvement in attacks, including the assassination of an Israeli minister in 2001.\n\nImage source, ReutersImage caption, Jared Kushner, a former Middle East mediator, joined Trump's current envoy Steve Witkoff in the effort to end the Gaza war\n\nThe Hamas official who spoke to the BBC said the group had \"shown the necessary positivity and responsibility to achieve the required progress and complete the agreement\", but acknowledged that differences remained between the two sides.\"Mediators are making major efforts to remove any obstacles to implementing a ceasefire,\" he added, noting that \"a spirit of optimism is spreading among all participants.\"However, a Palestinian official familiar with talks told the BBC that there were \"deep gaps\" over how Hamas and Israel interpreted Trump's 20-point peace plan.The official said disagreements had emerged over nearly all the key issues, including the map showing the three phases of Israeli troop withdrawals from Gaza, and the timetable for the hostage-prisoner exchange.On Wednesday afternoon, mediators presented a withdrawal map described as a compromise between Hamas's demand for troops to pull back to positions they held in March and Israel's demand to stick to the map distributed by the White House last week, which left about 55% of Gaza under Israeli control during the first phase.A Palestinian source said the mediators were \"trying to craft a formula for a gradual and monitored withdrawal\", and that their proposed map would leave about 40% of Gaza under Israeli control.\n\nImage source, ReutersImage caption, On Tuesday night, a mass rally in Tel Aviv demanded an end to two years of suffering for Israeli hostages and their families\n\nIsrael's Haaretz newspaper cited several Israeli security sources as saying on Wednesday afternoon that there was \"a high likelihood for progress, with the possibility of closing the deal in the coming days\".The sources added that Trump was himself \"intensely involved\" in the negotiations.Earlier, Yedioth Ahronoth reported that Israeli officials were \"cautiously optimistic\".\n\nMedia caption, BBC Verify examines what we know about the hostages remaining in Gaza\n\nOn Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Trump had asked him during a recent phone call to \"persuade\" Hamas to accept his plan.\n\nBut he told lawmakers from his AK party that it was also important to put pressure on Israel, saying its attacks on Gaza were \"the greatest obstacle before the path leading to peace\".\n\nThe Israeli military appears to have scaled back its ground offensive on Gaza City in recent days following a request from Trump on Friday to \"stop the bombing\".\n\n- Gaza war in maps and satellite images - What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza? - Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained\n\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Wednesday that Israeli fire had killed at least eight people over the previous 24 hours – the lowest death toll it has reported in the past week.\n\nHospitals said two people had been killed on Wednesday while trying to collect food from aid distribution centres in central and southern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military meanwhile said its troops had killed \"several terrorists\" who attempted to attack their position in Gaza City.\n\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.\n\nAt least 67,183 have been killed by Israeli military operations in Gaza since then, including 20,179 children, according to the territory's health ministry. Its figures are seen as reliable by the UN and other international bodies, although Israel disputes them.\n\nThe ministry has said another 460 people have died from the effects of malnutrition since the start of the war, including 182 since a famine was confirmed in Gaza City in August by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza and said Israel is facilitating deliveries of food and other aid.\n\nAdditional reporting by Helen Sullivan\n\n- Trump says chance of Gaza peace deal 'really good' as talks to continue in EgyptPublished2 days ago - What are the key sticking points in Trump's Gaza peace plan?Published2 days ago\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

More than 67,000 people in the Palestinian enclave have been killed, with many more wounded and maimed. - Most of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million people have been forced from their homes. Malnutrition has become widespread, [famine has been declared in parts of the enclave](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/gaza/famine-declared-gaza-city-israel-military-takeover-hamas-ceasefire-rcna225776), and large swaths have been reduced to rubble. - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to “change the Middle East” in the wake of the attack, and in a resulting multifront war, Israel has struck Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran. - While most of Israel’s longtime allies supported its actions in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7, over time the war’s toll on civilians has prompted outrage and condemnation and fueled a renewed drive to recognize a Palestinian state. - This week, Israel and Hamas[began indirect talks](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/gaza/gaza-ceasefire-deal-israel-hamas-trump-netanyahu-kushner-rcna235680) over President Donald Trump’s plan, which could end the two-year war and free the remaining hostages from Gaza.\n\nShare\n\n## My heart's ‘still on Oct. 7,’ says hostage's mother\n\nFreddie Clayton\n\nNimrod Cohen was 19 and performing his military service when he was kidnapped from an Israeli tank on Oct. 7, 2023. Two years later, now 21, he remains a hostage in the enclave alongside 47 other people and is still believed to be alive.His mother, Viki, has given multiple interviews, attended protests and traveled on delegations abroad since he was kidnapped, but she says her heart “is still on Oct. 7.”Nimrod Cohen.Family photo“It’s Rosh Hashanah, Kippur, Sukkot, but for us, it’s not, it’s sad days, and we cannot celebrate until Nimrod will be back home,” she told NBC News. “I think many, many of the people in Israel feel the same. They feel that they cannot really celebrate unless the hostages will be back home.”Nimrod should be home already, Cohen added, saying he was due to be released in the second phase of the ceasefire that fell apart in March when Israel launched a barrage of deadly airstrikes on Gaza.Show more“Israel decided not to get to the second phase, and she started the war again,” Cohen said. “We were really disappointed, and it broke my heart.”For that reason, Cohen struggles to get too excited about the prospect of another ceasefire being negotiated in Egypt.“I don’t want to be disappointed again, but I still have hope that maybe something good will happen,” she said, before she called on members of the Israel government not to “torpedo” the agreement. Maybe, she said, “it will happen after all, and I can hug my son.”\n\nShare\n\n## Nutrition, health and hygiene — UNRWA records toll of war in Gaza\n\nFreddie Clayton\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed over 66,000 people, including 18,430 in Gaza, according to a United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees report detailing the extent of the destruction in the strip after two years of war.The agency, known as UNRWA, said that nearly all of Gaza's residents have been displaced, many multiple times, and that nearly 80% of structures across the enclave have been damaged or destroyed.There have been at least 455 malnutrition-related deaths, including those of over 150 children, the report said, adding that war had also caused a spread of infectious diseases, including respiratory infections, acute watery diarrhea, scabies and skin rashes.The report also cited the immense impact on health services, saying that \"over 790 attacks on health workers, patients, hospitals, and other medical infrastructure in Gaza\" had taken place and that less than 40% of hospitals remain functional.Nearly 660,000 children had been forced out of school for a third year in a row, UNRWA said, while half a million girls lacked sufficient menstrual hygiene facilities.\n\nShare\n\nNBC News\n\nA drone video captured families and friends paying respect today to the more than 370 people killed at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nShare\n\n## U.N. chief calls for 'just and lasting peace'\n\nElmira Aliieva\n\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres today renewed his call for the release of all hostages and an end to the war in Gaza, calling for a peace process that allows Israelis and Palestinians to live peacefully.“A permanent ceasefire and a credible political process are essential to prevent further bloodshed & pave the way for peace,” he wrote on X, referring to Trump’s recent proposal.The only path forward is “a just & lasting peace, in which Israelis, Palestinians & all the peoples of the region live side by side in security, dignity and mutual respect,” he added.\n\nShare\n\n## Head of Hamas delegation has ‘great appreciation’ for Trump effort to end war in Gaza\n\nNBC News\n\nKhalil Al-Hayya, the head of the Hamas delegation taking part in peace talks in Egypt, said in an interview with Egypt’s state-owned Al-Qahera News television station today that his group had come \"to conduct responsible and serious negotiations.\"He added, \"We do not forget to renew our great appreciation for all the efforts made by the Arab, Islamic and international countries and brothers, as well as the efforts of U.S. President Trump in seeking to stop this war and end it forever.\"Al-Hayya was one of the main targets of an Israeli strike in Qatar last month, which killed his son.\n\nShare\n\n## The pain of loss is 'indescribable,' Palestinian journalist says\n\nFreddie ClaytonAmmar Cheikh OmarFreddie Clayton and Ammar Cheikh Omar\n\nAhmed al-Agha worked as a sports journalist in Gaza before the war began, but he has since turned to covering political news whenever he can, amid the search for safety and the \"struggle to find food.\"Al-Agha said he has lost track of the number of times he has been displaced — “seven to 10 times,” he said — but he continues to move from one area to another “in search of safety.”Ahmed Al-Agha.NBC News“Life has changed completely,” he told NBC News. “Some have lost their jobs, some have lost their relatives, some have lost family members, and some have lost friends.”Al-Agha said that the pain of loss is “indescribable” and that each day feels “like a hundred years.” We have to “divide meals, divide flour and even share a single loaf of bread,” he said, “because of the famine we have experienced and continue to face in the Gaza Strip.”A ceasefire “is the wish of every Palestinian,” he added. “There cannot be a normal life immediately after this war, but the Palestinian people are known for their love of life, their desire for coexistence, their passion for living, as long as there is a way.”\n\nShare\n\n## Netanyahu: 'We are in fateful days of decision'\n\nNBC News\n\nNetanyahu struck a defiant tone in a message on X reflecting on the Oct. 7 attacks.“Together, we broke the Iranian axis; together, we changed the face of the Middle East; together, we will ensure the eternity of Israel,” he wrote. “Citizens of Israel: We are in fateful days of decision. We will continue to act to achieve all the war’s objectives: the return of all the hostages, the elimination of Hamas’ rule, and ensuring that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.”\n\nShare\n\n## ‘Nothing here is like the rest of the world’\n\nFreddie ClaytonAmmar Cheikh OmarFreddie Clayton and Ammar Cheikh Omar\n\nWhen Sobhi Asour’s brother died in 2007, he took care of his 3-year-old son, raising him, marrying him off and later welcoming two granddaughters to the world.But Asour's heart was broken when his adopted son died during the war, he said, hit by an Israeli airstrike.Sobhi Asour.NBC News“It was not his father who raised him; I was his father,” he told NBC News. “I took him as an orphan, lived with him and my children, raised him, married him, built for him. Everything is gone.”Asour said he had lost “all desire for life” but swore he would never leave Gaza.Show more“We are heading into winter now,” he said. “Our tents are torn, and as you see, the sun scorches us. Winter is coming, and I hope it does not. We are thinking now how we will cover ourselves and our little children.”In Gaza, “nothing here is like the rest of the world,” he said. “Even if you had a fortune, it would vanish.”A displaced Palestinian woman at a camp in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip following an Israeli strike on Aug. 21.Eyad Baba / AFP via Getty Images\n\nShare\n\n## Germans honor victims of Oct. 7, demand release of hostages\n\n[Daniel Arkin](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/daniel-arkin-ncpn1206)\n\nBerliners gathered in public today to pay tribute to the Israelis killed on Oct. 7 and call for the release of the hostages still in Hamas captivity in Gaza.Shoes belonging to revelers at the Nova Music Festival in Israel on display at the Nova Music Festival Exhibition in Berlin on the second anniversary of the Hamas attack.Sean Gallup / Getty ImagesPeople — including a woman holding a sign that reads, \"Hamas out of Gaza!\" — gather with Israeli flags in Berlin on the second anniversary of the Hamas attack.Sean Gallup / Getty ImagesThe demonstrators projected the image of an Israeli flag on the Brandenburg Gate, along with the words \"Bring Them Home Now.\" Meanwhile, items recovered from the Nova Music Festival massacre were put on display at an exhibition in the city.The Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.Nadja Wohlleben / Reuters\n\nShare\n\n## ‘We could’ve been here much earlier’: Hostage cousin bemoans long wait for deal\n\nMatt Bradley\n\nReporting from Tel Aviv\n\nUdi Goren’s cousin Tal Haimi was killed in the Oct. 7 attacks, his body taken to Gaza, where it remains today.Two years later, Goren, 44, can scarcely believe he’s still waiting to see his cousin, having been certain it would take only “weeks, maybe a couple of months,” before the war ended.“I remember being here on the 100th day, and we thought it was insane that we made it to 100 days,” he told NBC News from Hostages Square in Tel Aviv.Disappointed and angry, Goren said he wanted to support Trump's ceasefire deal, which he said could “end this catastrophe and bring everybody back home.”“President Trump is supporting and pushing this deal very, very firmly,” he said. “And we see that he’s trying to hold up his commitment to ending wars, cutting deals and bringing peace.”Show moreWhile Goren holds Hamas fully responsible for the killing of his cousin, he blames the decision-makers in Israel, including Netanyahu, for the long wait to see his cousin he has suffered.“I think we could’ve been at this point much earlier,” he said. While Trump’s peace plan would grant amnesty to members of Hamas, Goren said that “if this plan actually brings a better future for my daughter, then who cares about the past?”\n\nShare\n\n## Israeli military says two reservists were 'severely injured' in southern Gaza\n\n[Daniel Arkin](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/daniel-arkin-ncpn1206)\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said two military reservists were \"severely injured during combat\" in the southern Gaza Strip earlier today. \"The soldiers were evacuated to a hospital to receive medical treatment, and their families have been notified,\" the IDF said in a statement.\n\nShare\n\n## Last six months a ‘catastrophe’ for Israel, analyst says\n\nFreddie Clayton\n\nThe war between Hamas and Israel should have ended in March, according to one analyst, saying the country has suffered on the international stage.Until the ceasefire this year, “I think there was a legitimacy from the international community about what Israel was doing,” said Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University’s Dayan Center.There were “many achievements,” he added, “not only in Gaza, but also in Lebanon.”But since Israel “decided to renew the war, we are sparking a new conflict, and the disadvantages of this period are much more than any achievements we had.”Smoke rises from an Israeli strike in Gaza today.Chris McGrath / Getty ImagesNow, Milshtein said, Israel faces “increasing isolation regarding the international community,” with “the majority of Israelis not supporting the war, and there is no clear strategy.”The last six months have been “a catastrophe” for Israel, he said.\n\nShare\n\n## Satellite images reveal extent of destruction in Gaza\n\nFreddie ClaytonMax ButterworthFreddie Clayton and Max Butterworth\n\nNew satellite imagery lays bare the sheer scale of the destruction in the Gaza Strip with two years of Israeli bombardment having turned much of the landscape into a wasteland.\n\nThe images show the Palestinian enclave from when the Israel-Hamas war began after Oct. 7, 2023, and from last month.\n\nAn estimated 80% of Gaza’s structures have been damaged or destroyed in that time, according to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.\n\n[Read the full story here.](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/gaza/satellite-images-destruction-gaza-strip-rcna236089)\n\nShare\n\n## Israeli president: 'We will not rest' until all hostages returned\n\n[Daniel Arkin](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/daniel-arkin-ncpn1206)\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog commemorated the Oct. 7 attacks in a post on X and repeated calls for the release of all hostages in Hamas captivity.\"We will not rest, we will not be silent, until all 48 hostages are home,\" Herzog wrote.\"The story of Israel is the story of resilience, of a people who will never give up, never give in, and never stop believing that light will overcome the darkness,\" Herzog added.Herzog also extended his thanks to Trump, commending the president for his \"incredible efforts to bring all our hostages home and bring peace to the Middle East. I pray for the success of his efforts and the success of the negotiating teams.\"\n\nShare\n\n## Before-and-after video shows much of Gaza reduced to ruins\n\nWill Clark\n\nBefore-and-after video shows much of Gaza reduced to ruins after two years of war.

It’s un-British to have so little respect for others,\" he said. \"And that’s before some of them decide to start chanting hatred towards Jewish people all over again.\"Student protesters march for Gaza in London today.Justin Tallis / AFP - Getty Images\n\nShare\n\n## The quiet inside the hardest-hit community in Israel\n\nMarc Smith\n\nReporting from Kibbutz Be’eri\n\nThere is little movement on the streets of Kibbutz Be’eri in southern Israel.Three miles from the Gaza border, Be’eri was the single hardest-hit community in Hamas’ attack two years ago. In this kibbutz, 102 people were killed and more than 30 were kidnapped.The silence is broken by the buzz of construction tools, a sign that a family has chosen to rebuild here. But most of the 125 damaged and destroyed homes remain untouched, stuck in time for the past 730 days.Show moreFood lay scattered across kitchen counters and pairs of shoes sit by front doors, as flowers bloom from the ashes of burned-out homes.Banners hang from the eaves of many houses, a solemn reminder to mark where residents were either killed or kidnapped.At the Ben Ami family home, two banners sway in the breeze — one with the face of Ohad Ben Ami, the other showing his wife, Raz. Inside the house, Ohad Ben Ami told NBC News what happened when the kibbutz was overrun two years ago.He was with his wife, he said, sheltering in a safe room as Hamas militants approached with their guns drawn and firing.Ohad Ben Ami stands in the house where he was kidnapped.Amir Levy / Getty ImagesGesturing with his hands in the air, Ohad described how he surrendered to the gunmen, proclaiming to them that he was the only one in the home as his wife remained hidden under a blanket.“I was sure that they were going to lynch me,” Ohad said. Instead, they loaded him into a vehicle bound for Gaza, where he became one of the some 250 hostages taken by Hamas and other militant factions that day.Ohad’s wife, Raz, faced a similar fate. She was discovered and kidnapped, too, held hostage for 54 days before her release. But Ohad languished as a prisoner of Hamas for 491 days — much of that time spent underground in Hamas’ vast tunnel system. Held with five fellow hostages, Ohad described how the group was overcome with anxiety and exhaustion.“All of us were nervous, all of us hungry,” Ohad said. “They were starving us.” Earlier this year, in February, Ohad was released in a prisoner exchange. But from his home in Be’eri, where this ordeal began, he says that he often feels like he’s back in the tunnels beneath Gaza with those he left behind. It’s a feeling he can’t shake, he said, until all the remaining hostages return home. Now, as negotiations are progressing in Egypt, he said he’s more encouraged than ever before.“I’m very optimistic. Because the Arab states agreed to this, and Israel agreed to this, and Hamas agreed to this, and Donald Trump is knocking on the table,” he said. “It will happen, I’m telling you, this time it will be finished.”\n\nShare\n\n## U.S. officials join hostage families and captivity survivors in 'Sukkah of Hope'\n\n[Daniel Arkin](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/daniel-arkin-ncpn1206)\n\nTrump administration officials joined a group of Israeli hostage families and captivity survivors today for a breakfast at Washington's Kennedy Center inside the \"Sukkah of Hope,\" a temporary dwelling built for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.The representatives from the U.S. government included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.\"Families expressed deep gratitude for the administration’s leadership and reiterated the urgency of finalizing the agreement to ensure the immediate release of all hostages,\" according to a news release from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.Trump administration officials joined a group of Israeli hostage families and captivity survivors today for a breakfast at Washington's Kennedy Center.Liri AgamiThe captivity survivors who attended the breakfast included Noa Argamani and Keith Siegel.Sukkot is a seven-day Jewish holiday celebrating the traditional gathering of the harvest. It started at sundown Monday and runs through Oct. 13.\n\nShare\n\n## ‘It’s not the same Israel’\n\nFreddie Clayton\n\nTwo years after the Oct. 7 attacks, Eyal Eshel still remembers the morning he lost contact with his daughter, 19-year-old soldier Roni Eshel.From her post in the command room at the Nahal Oz base, less than a kilometer from the Gaza Strip, she never answered his calls that day.“She didn’t answer for me on the phone from the moment of 6:23, actually, until today,” he told NBC News. “But I tried and I tried and I tried, for a long time, the whole day.”Eshel said the feeling he had on Oct. 7 is “exactly the same feeling” he has today — with 48 hostages both dead and alive still trapped in Gaza — something he holds the government accountable for.“We are in a big s---,” he said. “It’s not the same Israel.”Show moreSince Oct. 7, Eshel has sought accountability from Israel’s leadership. He has thrown his support behind an unofficial civil commission of inquiry that has been collecting evidence of intelligence failures surrounding the Hamas attacks, and he continues to call for sweeping political and military change — what he calls a “reset.”“The government should go away from us, then we need to change the officers in the army that are still in charge from Oct. 7,” he said. “Then we should learn how to rebuild our life here in Israel, from the beginning, like the same year of 1948, somebody needs to make the reset.”This morning, family and friends gathered at Park Roni, a public memorial built last year near their home in Tzur Yitzhak, filled with her beloved fruit trees.“It’s a special day,” he said. “This is how we’re going to remember her.”\n\nShare\n\n## ‘Everything’ could still cause talks to fail, Israeli opposition leader tells NBC News\n\nMatt Bradley\n\nReporting from Tel Aviv\n\nIn ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, “everything” could still cause talks to fail, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said today.“We are dealing with a terrible terror organization; these are not normal people,” he told NBC News from Hostages Square in Tel Aviv. “And therefore everything that might go wrong, might go wrong, so to speak.”Israel and Hamas are conducting indirect talks over Trump’s plan to halt the two-year war and free the remaining hostages from Gaza.Lapid said the ongoing negotiations are the “most serious effort” so far.“President Trump has contributed to this so much of his time and effort,” he added. “We are thankful and grateful and yet there’s so many obstacles.”\n\nShare\n\n## Nothing left of my dreams, Gaza pharmacist says\n\nAmmar Cheikh OmarFreddie ClaytonAmmar Cheikh Omar and Freddie Clayton\n\nDoaa Basem al-Masri had graduated from university with honors and dreamed of studying abroad to continue her research on cancer cells when the war broke out.Once living in a house that had “all the necessities, electricity, food, water,” the pharmacist now lives in makeshift accommodation in a school, sharing a two-by-two-meter space with nine other members of her family, where they sleep, eat, and store their belongings in the same place.“There is no longer a university, no home, no country — nothing left of these dreams,” she told NBC News. “We are only struggling through our days to survive, hoping to hear of a truce or even a temporary ceasefire so that we can catch a breath from this devastating war.”Despite the hardships, Al-Masri has continued to run a pharmacy, which she says has been relocated “four or five times” during the war and requires her to walk long distances every day to visit patients in their tents.Doaa Basem Al-Masri.NBC NewsShow more“It’s extremely difficult to provide medicines for patients, especially those with chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer,” she added. “We are losing innocent lives.”Al-Masri says she recently lost her cousin, a teacher and a mother of four, she said was killed by an Israeli airstrike along with her husband.“It has been extremely difficult to provide for these orphans,” she said. “There is no one to extend a helping hand.”After multiple displacements, and a battle to keep her pharmacy open, Al-Masri says the hardships have made her family “stronger than ever before.”“We have been shaped into people who fight to survive,” she said. “We will never give up our right to return.”\n\nShare\n\n## U.S. officials pay tribute to Oct. 7 victims\n\nFreddie Clayton\n\nTop U.S. officials have paid tribute to the victims of the Oct. 7 attacks, calling for peace in the region and the release of all hostages.Hamas “murdered more than 1,200 innocent men, women, and children — including 46 Americans — in the most brutal terrorist attack in Israel’s history,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement this morning.Under Trump, “America is leading the effort to secure the release of all hostages, end Hamas’s rule in Gaza, and advance a durable peace that ensures not only Israel’s security, but generational peace and prosperity for the region.”Vice President JD Vance echoed Rubio’s tribute to the victims, adding that the U.S. was working toward Trump’s ceasefire plan “to bring the remaining hostages home and build a lasting peace for all.\n\nShare\n\n## On day of pain and remembrance, hopes of peace are rising\n\n[Richard Engel](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/richard-engel-ncpn1851)\n\nReporting from Jerusalem\n\nAcross Israel this morning, there were somber gatherings to mark the attacks two years ago, including in the country's south, where families and friends paid respects to the more than 370 victims killed at the Nova music festival.",

(Canadian Tire Corporation Economic Impact Report)\n\n/$\n\n## Social Sharing\n\nThe owner of an Etobicoke-based Canadian Tire store has been fined $111,000 by the federal government for violating the guidelines of Canada's Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) program.\n\nEmployment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), the federal ministry that runs the TFW program, found branch owner Ezhil Natarajan in violation of two guidelines: that wages, work conditions or the job did not match what was listed in offers of employment and that employees were assigned to work different roles than what they were hired for.\n\nThe violations were reported on [a public database](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/employers-non-compliant.html#list4) that lists employers' compliance with the TFW program, which listed Natarajan's company, Geethaezhil Inc., as \"ineligible\" for the program due to an unpaid fine.\n\nESDC's final decision in July this year came after two of the Etobicoke branch's former employees [spoke out to CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/temporary-foreign-workers-closed-work-permits-1.7354068) alleging mistreatment, poor working conditions and being paid less than agreed-upon wages by Natarajan.\n\nNatarajan did not immediately respond to CBC News' request for comment Monday.\n\nHe has owned and managed various Canadian Tire stores through his company GeethaEzhil Inc. since 2012, according to a LinkedIn profile seen by CBC News last year.\n\nOntario's Ministry of Labour said an investigation into Natarajan is ongoing.\n\n*WATCH | Two foreign workers who quit Canadian Tire store reveal working conditions: :*Foreign workers who quit Canadian Tire allege poor conditions, pay issues October 23, 2024Duration 2:36Two foreign workers who used to work at Canadian Tire are speaking out about what they allege were poor working conditions and pay issues that led them to quit. They say their experience underscores the challenges faced by many temporary workers in the country.\n\nThe ESDC said in an emailed statement that it could not comment on the investigation to anyone other than the employer \"due to privacy considerations.\"\n\nIt confirmed Geethaezhil Inc. was issued an \"administrative and monetary penalty\" for non-compliance with the TFW program.\n\n\"Consequently, because of an unpaid monetary penalty this employer is not authorized to hire temporary foreign workers,\" said the ESDC statement, adding anyone who fails to pay a penalty will also be barred from the international mobility program and will be \"subject to collection activities.\"\n\nEmployers are able to appeal the ESDC's decision by requesting a judicial review by a federal court, it said.\n\n- ['It's like a cage': Foreign workers who quit Canadian Tire speak out about feeling trapped by work permits](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/temporary-foreign-workers-closed-work-permits-1.7354068)\n\n- [Alberta companies ordered to repay almost $165K to temporary foreign workers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/alberta-companies-temporary-foreign-workers-1.7564659)\n\nTemporary foreign workers have the same employment standards and protections as Canadian citizens and permanent residents, including the right to change employers if they meet eligibility criteria for a new work permit, said an emailed statement from Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).\n\nThe IRCC said there are programs, like the open work permit for vulnerable workers, and regulations in place to support and strengthen protections for temporary foreign workers.\n\nThe government also operates a confidential tip line, available around the clock, for any temporary foreign workers who feel uncomfortable reporting mistreatment, said the IRCC.\n\n\"This tip line provides a safe place for temporary foreign workers to report abuse without reprisal. Every tip received is reviewed and appropriate actions are taken within 48 hours,\" it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian Tire did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.\n\nBut the company's website notes that stores are all independently owned and operated, and that each store has the \"sole and exclusive right to interview, select, hire and train their staff.\"\n\nThe Canadian Tire owned by Ezhil Natarajan opened in 2023. (Michael Cole/CBC)\n\n## Owner underpaid, poorly treated employees: foreign workers\n\nRowell Pailan told CBC News last year that he was hired through the TFW program to work at the Canadian Tire store owned by Natarajan.\n\nHe said the job offer for a full-time store supervisor position was very appealing, until his hourly pay rate was reduced from $20 per hour to $16.50 per hour.\n\nPailan said Natarajan informed him of the change in a private conversation and threatened to terminate him if he told anyone about it.\n\nRowell Pailan, left, lives in Wolfville, N.S., and Jhan Cresencio, right, lives in Labrador City. Both allege Natarajan underpaid and poorly treated foreign workers in interviews with CBC News. (CBC/Courtesy Jhan Cresencio)\n\nAnother worker, Jhan Cresencio, told CBC News last year that Natarajan shouted at him in a derogatory manner in 2023, after he lent his key to another employee to retrieve something from a break room.\n\nCresencio was able to convert to an open work permit through a program meant specifically for TFWs undergoing abuse or at risk of abuse.\n\nWhen an employee is approved for an open work permit for vulnerable workers, that triggers an inspection of the employer to make sure foreign workers are being treated according to their job offers, said the IRCC in a statement to CBC News last year.\n\nCresencio and Pailan moved to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia respectively in search of other opportunities.\n\nWhen told of the fine, Pailan said: \"I'm so happy that we got justice. It's a good thing. Maybe for now, he'll think twice... for not doing this to the future employees.\"\n\nPailan, who now lives in Wolfville, N.S., said he had been waiting for a long time for an update on the case and had been wondering what happened. Cresencio has not yet responded to a request for comment about the fine.\n\n*WATCH | Ontario fined Alberta recruitment companies for charging job placement fees: :*Alberta companies ordered to repay foreign workers $165KJune 19Duration 2:26A temporary foreign worker says he hopes the decision sends a message not to \"take advantage\" of newcomers. Shaina Luck has the story.\n\nPailan said he paid $7,900 US (approximately $10,000 Cdn) to an Alberta-based recruitment agency to get the job with Natarajan at Canadian Tire.\n\n[In June this year](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/alberta-companies-temporary-foreign-workers-1.7564659), the province fined Allison Jones Consulting and AJ Immigration Group $165,000 in eight cases — including Pailan's — for illegally charging workers for job placements.\n\nBoth companies will be appealing those decisions, said owner Allison Jones.\n\n/$\n\n$\n\n/$\n\n## ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nArrthy Thayaparan\n\nArrthy Thayaparan is a Toronto-based multimedia journalist.

      "content": "# ChatGPT image snares suspect in deadly Pacific Palisades fire\n\nA 29-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of starting the Pacific Palisades fire in Los Angeles that killed 12 people and destroyed more than 6,000 homes in January.\n\nEvidence collected from Jonathan Rinderknecht's digital devices included an image he generated on ChatGPT depicting a burning city, justice department officials said.\n\nOne of the most destructive blazes in LA history, the fire erupted on 7 January near a hiking trail that overlooked the wealthy coastal neighbourhood.\n\nThe Eaton Fire, ignited the same day in the LA area, killed another 19 people and razed 9,400 structures. The cause of that fire remains unclear.\n\nThe Palisades fire scorched more than 23,000 acres (9,308 hectares) and caused about $150bn (£112bn) in damage.\n\nWiping out whole neighbourhoods, the conflagration raged for more than three weeks, also ravaging parts of Topanga and Malibu.\n\nAmong the thousands of structures destroyed in the fires were the homes of a number of celebrities, including Mel Gibson, Paris Hilton and Jeff Bridges.\n\nMr Rinderknecht was arrested in Florida on Tuesday and has been charged with destruction of property by means of fire, Acting US Attorney Bill Essayli told a news conference on Wednesday in Los Angeles.\n\n\"The arrest, we hope, will offer a measure of justice to all those impacted,\" Mr Essayli said.\n\nOfficials said further charges - including murder - could follow.\n\nMr Rinderknecht appeared in court in Florida on Wednesday. He did not enter a plea.\n\nHe is scheduled to return to the US District Court in Orlando on Thursday for a bond hearing. He is not expected to enter an official plea until his arraignment hearing in Los Angeles in the coming weeks.\n\nMr Rinderknecht had been living and working in California, and moved to Florida shortly after the fire, according to authorities.\n\nThe initial blaze Mr Rinderknecht allegedly started on New Year's Day was called the Lachman fire.\n\nAlthough it was quickly suppressed by firefighters, it continued to smoulder underground in the root structure of dense vegetation, according to investigators, before it flared up again above ground in a windstorm.\n\nThe suspect was familiar with the area because he was a former resident of Pacific Palisades, officials said. He had lived one block away from the Skull Rock Trailhead, where he allegedly started the fire.\n\nHe lit it with an open flame after he completed a ride as an Uber driver on New Year's Eve, according to the indictment.\n\nTwo passengers rode with Mr Rinderknecht earlier on New Year's Eve. One passenger told investigators he remembered the driver had appeared agitated and angry.\n\nOfficials said they had used his phone data to pinpoint his location when the fire initially started on 1 January, but when they pressed him on details he allegedly lied to investigators, claiming he was near the bottom of the trail.\n\nUber said Mr Rinderknecht wasn't on the popular ride-sharing app at the time of the fire, but the company worked closely with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to help determine his whereabouts using GPS data and other relevant information.\n\nThe company also said it removed Mr Rinderknecht's access to its platform as soon as it learned of his suspected involvement in the fire, but it noted he passed his initial background check in 2023 and annual check-ins thereafter.\n\nAuthorities said they also found other links between Mr Rinderknecht and the fire on his phone, including videos that Mr Rinderknecht had taken of firefighters trying to put out the flames.\n\nThe phone also showed that he repeatedly called 911 just after midnight on New Year's day, but could not get through because of patchy mobile reception on the trailhead. There was a screen recording of him trying to call emergency services and at one point being connected with a dispatcher.\n\nMr Rinderknecht also asked ChatGPT: \"Are you at fault if a fire is lift [sic] because of your cigarettes?\"\n\nInvestigators said the suspect wanted to \"preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire\".\n\nInvestigators noted that Mr Rinderknecht appeared nervous during their interview with him on 24 January this year, and his carotid artery would pulsate whenever he was asked who had started the fire.\n\nIn July 2024, five months before he allegedly set the fire, Mr Rinderknecht asked ChatGPT to create an image of a \"dystopian painting\" that included a burning forest and a crowd of people running away from a fire, according to investigators.\n\nHis prompt to the AI tool included the text: \"In the middle [of the painting], hundreds of thousands of people in poverty are trying to get past a gigantic gate with a big dollar sign on it.\n\n\"On the other side of the gate and the entire wall is a conglomerate of the richest people.\n\n\"They are chilling, watching the world burn down, and watching the people struggle. They are laughing, enjoying themselves, and dancing.\"\n\nA month before allegedly setting the fire, Mr Rinderknecht allegedly inputted a prompt to ChatGPT that included the text: \"I literally burnt the Bible that I had. It felt amazing. I felt so liberated.\"\n\nAn outside review into the fire that was commissioned by Los Angeles County supervisors found that \"outdated policies\" for sending emergency alerts had delayed evacuation warnings, among other official failings.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom called the arrest an important step toward \"bringing closure to the thousands of Californians whose lives were upended\".\n\nHe added that the state was supporting the federal investigation into the fire.\n\nHours after Mr Rinderknecht's arrest, the Los Angeles City Fire Department (LAFD) released its long-awaited After-Action Review Report (AARR) on the Palisades Fire, which detailed the first 36 hours of the department's response.\n\nThe report - meant to identify lessons learned from the response and to enhance preparedness and response for future wildfires - found firefighters did not have enough resources for the red flag weather conditions and hurricane-force winds that fuelled the fire.\n\nLAFD listed nearly 100 challenges that firefighters faced during the Palisades fire, which burned for 25 days and forced many fire responders to work for 36 to 48 hours straight.\n\n\"Responders were faced with the inevitable consequences of a perfect storm: dry vegetation, unrelenting and unusual wind activity, significant ember cast, a landscape packed with combustible vegetation, large vulnerable structures, a diminishing water supply, and a loss of aerial suppression support,\" the report said.\n\nAdditionally, firefighters were unable to secure the origin of the fire, faced issues recalling off-duty firefighters to respond and blamed fire chiefs with little experience for handling a blaze of that magnitude.\n\nDelays in communicating evacuation orders and issues with arranging effective evacuations and traffic also created problems.\n\nLAFD Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva, who replaced sacked fire chief Kristin Crowley, said that he hoped the report \"strengthens public confidence in the Los Angeles Fire Department's readiness to respond to any future wildfires\".\n\nThe department, he said, has since implemented several new processes to protect the city, including upgrading communications technology.\n\nNewsom's office has also requested a review by the nation's leading fire safety researchers.\n\n## Maps and images reveal scale of LA wildfire devastation\n\n## Timelapse captures intensity of roaring fire in Palisades\n\n## LA firefighters battle to contain monster inferno as death toll rises",

The only problems will be for those who supply them and those who use them; that's where the problems will be,” he said.\n\nRussia’s deputy foreign minister also warned [Washington](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/washington) against allowing Tomahawk missiles to be sent to Ukraine, describing it as a potentially \"qualitative\" change in US involvement in the war.\n\nTrump said he wants to know what Ukraine plans to do with Tomahawks before agreeing to provide them.\n\nRecommended\n\n- [India is now lead supplier of fuel additives for Russia’s fighter jets, Ukrainian think tank warns](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/india-russia-ukraine-war-fuel-additives-b2842191.html) - [Indian man fighting with Russian forces surrenders to Ukrainian Army, Kyiv says](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-ukraine-army-india-gujarat-soldier-video-b2841384.html) - [Ukrainian refugee who fled war-torn home is now sumo’s rising star](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/danilo-yavhushyshyn-sumo-wrestling-japan-b2842418.html) - [Starmer won’t say if he plans to press Modi on close ties to Putin](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-india-modi-putin-b2842219.html)\n\n### Ukrainian firefighters extinguish blaze in Odesa after drone strike\n\n(UKRAINIAN EMERGENCY SERVICE/AFP)\n\n(UKRAINIAN EMERGENCY SERVICE/AFP)\n\nDaniel Keane9 October 2025 12:30\n\n### Sanctions are hitting Russia but US and China are holding back, says EU sanctions chief\n\nEU sanctions chief David O’Sullivan said sanctions are clearly damaging Russia’s economy, but he warned that US commitment to further measures remains uncertain.\n\nHe called the US decision not to join other G7 members in lowering the Russian oil price cap “regrettable” and said it is an “open question” whether US president Donald Trump will back more sanctions, despite signs he is “losing patience” with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe stressed the need to close loopholes as Russia keeps finding ways to circumvent sanctions, and urged more US pressure on EU countries like Slovakia and Hungary to stop Russian energy imports.\n\nHe also warned that China is a key hub for sanctions evasion.\n\n“We do see evidence that China is a platform for the import and re-export to Russia of quite significant numbers of battlefield goods,” he told Reuters.\n\nTaz Ali9 October 2025 12:00\n\n### Strikes on Russian oil facilities causing 'significant gas shortages' in Russia\n\nStrikes on Russian oil facilities by Ukraine's newly developed long-range missiles and drones are causing significant gas shortages in Russia, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.\n\nThe Ukrainian president also said that a recent counter-offensive has derailed Russia's plans to capture parts of the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nUkraine's new Palianytsia missile has hit dozens of Russian military depots, Mr Zelensky said.\n\nThe Ruta missile drone, meanwhile, recently struck a Russian offshore oil platform more than 150 miles away in what Mr Zelensky called \"a major success\" for the new weapon.\n\nDaniel Keane9 October 2025 11:30\n\n### Putin personally afraid of ceasefire, says Zelensky\n\nVladimir Putin is \"personally afraid\" of a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.\n\n“The head of Russia is personally afraid of a ceasefire, because once a ceasefire is in place, returning to the war would be difficult for him. To move from full-scale war to a ceasefire and then later restart a full-scale war – that’s not easy for them,” Zelensky said on X today.\n\n“It’s not easy economically, it’s not easy with the society, and it’s not easy with the world. And certainly not easy with those countries that are still shaking Putin’s hand today. That’s why, for now, he chooses war,” he said.\n\nZelensky said Ukraine’s long-range strikes, strong sanctions, holding the battlefield, defending itself in the conflict at the moment but “also, undoubtedly, supporting peaceful initiatives, because that’s the right thing to do – this will work”.\n\nArpan Rai9 October 2025 10:33\n\n### In photos: Putin arrives for central Asia summit meetings in Tajikistan\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin arrived in Tajikistan yesterday to attend meetings with leaders of other ex-Soviet republics likely to focus on regional development and their relations with Moscow.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin attends talks with Tajik president Emomali Rahmon at the Palace of the Nation in Dushanbe (AP)\n\nVladimir Putin attends an official welcoming ceremony before a meeting in Dushanbe (Reuters)\n\nVladimir Putin and Tajik president Emomali Rakhmon tour the botanical garden prior to an informal dinner in Dushanbe (POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nArpan Rai9 October 2025 10:15\n\n### Russia gasoline supplies may be down by a fifth after Ukrainian attacks, says Zelensky\n\nUkraine’s long-range strikes on Russian energy facilities may have reduced gasoline supplies in Russia by up to 20 per cent, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.\n\nReuters calculations in August showed that Ukrainian attacks had reduced Russian oil refining by almost a fifth on certain days. Zelensky's comments implied that level of shortage was now ongoing.\n\n“This still needs to be verified, but we believe that they've lost up to 20% of their gasoline supply – directly as a result of our strikes,\" Zelensky said in remarks to journalists today.\n\nThe Kremlin has said that Russia's domestic fuel market is fully supplied.\n\nIn the recent weeks, as diplomatic efforts to end the war ground to a halt, Ukraine has been targeting Russia's oil refining capacity and Russian forces have focused on crippling Ukrainian gas production.\n\nArpan Rai9 October 2025 10:02\n\n### Watch: Huge fireball erupts as Russian attack hits Ukrainian oil depot\n\nHuge fireball erupts as Russian attack hits Ukrainian oil depot\n\nArpan Rai9 October 2025 09:42\n\n### Ukraine inflicts frontline losses on Russian troops in Donetsk, says Zelensky\n\nUkrainian forces were inflicting heavy losses in a counteroffensive in eastern Donetsk region, Volodymyr Zelensky said, contrasting Vladimir Putin’s claims that Russia holds the initiative in the region.\n\nSpeaking in his nightly video address, Zelensky said he spoke for almost an hour to top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi, with \"particular attention on the Dobropillia operation, our counteroffensive\".\n\nHe described heavy casualties in the area.Ukraine has pointed to successes in Dobropillia, just north of the logistics hub of Pokrovsk, one of the key targets in Russia's slow advance westward through Donetsk region.\n\nUkrainian forces, Zelensky said, were \"defending ourselves along all other directions,\" referring specifically to Kupiansk, a largely destroyed town in northeastern Ukraine under heavy Russian assaults for months.\n\nHe also described conditions as \"difficult\" around Novopavlivka, farther south in Zaporizhzhia region, but said \"our active defensive actions there are showing good results\".\n\nThe region has been the main theatre of the more than three and a half years of war in Ukraine.\n\n(X/Twitter)\n\nArpan Rai9 October 2025 09:00\n\n### Russia waging misinformation campaign to prevent US sending Tomahawk missiles\n\nThe Kremlin is trying to influence US decision-making on whether to send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine via its European partners, according to a key think-tank monitoring the war.\n\n“Kremlin officials continued to claim that US personnel will have to directly participate in Ukrainian Tomahawk strikes and that the missiles will not affect Russia’s determination to achieve its war goals or the situation on the battlefield,” the Institute for the Study of War said.\n\nYesterday senior Russian officials said Moscow would create \"problems\" for Europe if Donald Trump allows Tomahawk missiles to be sent to Ukraine.\n\nAndrei Kartapolov, head of the Russian parliament's defence committee, suggested Moscow would retaliate against any country that supplies the missiles to Ukraine.\n\n“We know these missiles very well, how they fly, how to shoot them down; we worked with them in Syria, so there is nothing new.

But they joined Israel's war cabinet after October 7 and re-merged with Likud this year.Sa'ar expressed \"pride\" at this decision, leading to \"the privilege of being part of important, sometimes bold, historic decisions\".\n\n12:35:00 Watch: Relief and joy at Hostages Square Hostages Square in Tel Aviv has played an important role in helping keep pressure on the Israeli government to secure the release of the captives held in Gaza.The families and friends of hostages have led protests in the square every week since the October 7 attacks, with images of the captives emblazoned across the area and a large digital clock counting every second they've been trapped in Gaza.Large crowds are expected to return to the square throughout today, but not in protest.Instead, they'll be celebrating the news that the hostages are due to return to Israel in the coming days.Sky News international correspondent Alex Rossi has been in the square this morning.Watch his report on the peace deal and what it means for the hostages below...\n\n12:22:00 'Biggest uncertainty' lies in road to second phase While many welcome the progress in the first phase of Donald Trump's peace plan, the UK's former national security adviser has a warning.Sir Mark Lyall Grant said all eyes should now focus on how the plan proceeds to the second phase - see the post just below this one for more on what that entails.That, he told our presenter Matt Barbet, is the \"biggest uncertainty of all\".\"[This] is where previous agreements of this kind have fallen back, fallen down, including in early on this year,\" he added. And Benjamin Netanyahu is \"still under massive political pressure domestically\". Watch the video below for his thoughts...\n\n12:08:00\n\nExplained: What will the first phase look like - and what's next?\n\nDonald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of the Gaza peace plan late last night.\n\nHe said on Truth Social: \"This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.\"\n\nWe're waiting for the Israeli government to ratify a ceasefire deal - expected this evening - after which the fighting should stop.\n\nIn the meantime, here's a recap of what it is supposed to establish, according to Donald Trump's initial 20-point proposal.\n\n### What should happen next:\n\n- Once an agreement is ratified by both sides, a **ceasefire**will immediately come into effect; - **Israel will withdraw** within 24 hours to the agreed upon line - Hamas said this will happen tomorrow; - Within 72 hours after that, all the **Israeli hostages**, alive and dead, will be released by Hamas - Israel says this could be on Sunday or Monday; - Once all the hostages are released,**Israel will free**250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans detained after October 7; - **Humanitarian aid**entering Gaza will increase to up to 600 trucks a day, according to both sides.\n\n### What remains pending:\n\n- Israel's government still needs to **ratify**the agreement, which is supposed to happen at a security cabinet meeting at 3pm UK time; - The **ceasefire needs to take hold** and last beyond the release of the hostages and the prisoners for the second phase to be initiated; - Hamas said that the mediators have provided **guarantees**to assure that the agreement won't be violated once its main leverage is gone; - Hamas will have to **disarm**, according to the plan's second phase, but has not discussed this yet; - Gaza's**future governance** remains uncertain, as Hamas says it will only relinquish its rule to a Palestinian government, not the plan's international board.\n\n**Here's a full breakdown of Trump's 20-point plan**\n\n11:58:00 Israel to withdraw from all Gaza cities tomorrow, says Hamas official Hamas official Osama Hamdan has shared some of the details of the ceasefire agreement that has been reached.Speaking to Qatari broadcaster Al-Araby TV - cited by the Times of Israel - Hamdan said Israel's military will withdraw tomorrow from Gaza's urban areas, including Gaza City, Rafah, and Khan Younis.He said that Israel has agreed to release 1,950 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of the hostages. But the exchange will not take place unless an agreement to end the war is publicly announced, he said in a statement shared on social media.According to Hamdan, mediators - which include Qatar, the US and Egypt - have provided guarantees that this agreement will not be violated.The ceasefire announcement would be left to the US side, Hamdan says.\n\n11:25:00 'Hamas should leave the political arena', says Palestinian analyst It remains to be seen what Gaza's future governing body will actually look like, if the peace plan goes ahead as hoped.Donald Trump's proposal seeks to oust Hamas and establish a temporary international government until a reformed Palestinian Authority takes control of Gaza.All that will have to be discussed in the second phase of negotiations, says Palestinian-British analyst Yousef al Helou, speaking to our presenter Matt Barbet.But he said Hamas must \"leave the political arena\" as Palestinians and the world \"have had enough\" of the conflict.Watch the video below for his full insight...\n\n11:12:00 In pictures: Smoke seen over Gaza after ceasefire deal announced Smoke from explosions can still be seen rising over Gaza, with Donald Trump's peace plan expected to come into effect later.The Israeli prime minister's office has said that a ceasefire will begin this evening after the deal is ratified by Israel's government.\n\n11:01:00 Arab neighbours hope for 'just peace' and end to war after Gaza agreement Israel's Arab neighbours, including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, have now also weighed in on the deal.Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry welcomes the agreement, saying it marks an important step towards achieving a comprehensive and just peace in the region.Jordan's foreign ministry says it hopes the first-phase deal would lead to an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, a prisoner exchange and the delivery of humanitarian aid.The foreign ministry of the United Arab Emirates - an Arab Gulf state located on the other side of the Arabian Peninsula - have also welcomed the deal and urged all parties to abide by the terms.\n\n10:49:00 Gazans dance as they celebrate ceasefire deal news Footage shows people in Gaza dancing and celebrating news of a ceasefire deal being reached between Israel and Hamas. A group of Palestinians in Khan Younis can be seen picking up a news reporter as music plays in the background. The warring factions agreed to the first phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan overnight, which will see hostages released and a pause in the two-year fighting.More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says around half were women and children.Israel's bombing campaign started in response to the unprecedented 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas, during which Israel says 1,200 people were massacred in the south and 251 were taken hostage.\n\nThis content is provided by , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

      "content": "birdkit: do not modify this file\n\nbirdkit: html header automatically hoisted to the head\n\nWe’ve interviewed more than 700 people in Gaza over the past two years. Their stories stayed with us.We kept wondering: Did they find their missing relatives? Are their homes standing? Did they bury their dead? Were they forced to flee again? Were they even still alive?So we tried to find them again. This is what they said.\n\nWe’re still alive. Amir Ahmed First spoke to us in October 2023I lost them all. Ahmed al-Dalou First spoke to us in October 2024What saved my daughter’s life was a miracle. Tamer Hamdan First spoke to us in June 2024I’ve lost 29 kilograms. Dr. Bakr Gaoud First spoke to us in November 2023Imagine paying $1,000 for a tent. Imagine paying for salty water. Aseel Mutair First spoke to us in March 2024I lost my children, my home, my siblings, my memories. I lost every beautiful thing in my life. Mohammed al-Aloul First spoke with us in February 2024He still has to undergo another amputation. Lubna al-Dahouk First spoke to us in November 2024Gaza has been erased. Muna Abu Holi First spoke to us in June 2024\n\n*No single experience* can fully contain the agony of Gaza, the near-obliteration of a society and a place.\n\nCollectively, however, the people we spoke to over the past two years have helped us see how the war has crushed those who have lived it.\n\nThey told us about the raw wounds of their grief, their fear of the next airstrike, their dread of tomorrow. About the first time they fled home as Israeli bombs and shells fell closer, the first time they put up a makeshift tent, the second time, the third.\n\nAbout their weakening bodies, their children crying for bread, their days searching for baby formula and lentils. About their hopes of being evacuated for medical treatment, of going back to school, of reuniting with their families.\n\nThis article is by Vivian Yee, Lauren Leatherby, Samar Abu Elouf, Bilal Shbair, Iyad Abuheweila, Abu Bakr Bashir and Aaron Boxerman. Oct. 6, 2025\n\n- Share full article\n\nWe tried to get back in touch with many of them. Many did not respond. Some phone numbers no longer worked. Others had escaped Gaza. Some, we learned, had been killed.\n\nOf the nearly 100 we reached, **everyone lost something or someone**: a family member, a friend, their home, hope.\n\nSince we last spoke, I lost two close family members. Aaed Abu Karsh First spoke to us in November 2024The loss of my daughter flashes before my eyes every day. And my husband still isn’t here. Muna Abu Holi First spoke to us in June 2024I lost my father since the first interview. He was killed during the bombing. Haya Al-Barai First spoke to us in November 2024I lost a sister, a brother, and nearly 40 relatives. That alone feels like more than enough grief for one lifetime. Ismail al-Sheikh First spoke to us in January 2025I am dying every single second after I lost her. Asmaa Dwaima First spoke to us in April 2024The physical losses are devastating, but the deeper wound is mental. Al-Hassan al-Harazeen First spoke to us in January 2025Our lives are nothing but suffering on top of suffering. We’ve lost relatives and been scattered across tents. Hanaa al-Najjar First spoke to us in April 2024Last July I lost my brother, Ramadan, who was only 37. Ramadan was my backbone. Naela al-Danaf First spoke to us in November 2024We are overwhelmed by loss. Every day, someone from our family is killed. Maryam al-Kafarneh First spoke to us in November 2024I lost my money, properties, supplies, and everything. Ramy Nasr First spoke to us in November 2024I lost hope that there is an end for this nightmare. Mohammed al-Baradei First spoke to us in April 2024Yousef Sager lost his own life. He spoke to us in 2024 about surviving on boiled weeds. We later learned that he had been killed in an airstrike. First spoke to us in April 2024\n\nSamar al-Jaja’s nephews, from left, Mahmoud, Mohammed, Ahmed and Abdullah. via Samar al-Jaja\n\nWhen we spoke last summer to Samar al-Jaja and her nephews, Mohammed, Mahmoud, Ahmed and Abdullah Akeila, it had been 10 months since the brothers’ parents and baby sister had been killed in an airstrike.Under their tent at a charity camp, they still held out hope that they would see their parents when they were allowed to go home to Gaza City.But when they got home earlier this year, only their parents’ bedroom was still standing.There was no one inside. The five of them stood there, numb.“The kids said sadly, ‘We wish we were buried with them,’” Ms. al-Jaja, 32, said when we contacted her again recently.They have never been able to mourn properly. The sweets that people in Gaza traditionally distribute on the anniversary of a death were too expensive to make, given the wartime price of flour and sugar.They couldn’t even say a prayer at their parents’ graves. They do not know where they are.“Even that closure has been taken from us,” she said.She spoke to us from a half-destroyed building in Gaza City where she and her nephews were sheltering.Days later, Israeli forces stormed the city, the latest operation in the two-year campaign against Hamas in Gaza, which began after the militant group’s deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.Negotiators from Israel and Hamas began holding talks in Cairo on Monday about a possible swap of Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinians in Israeli prisons. If they agree, the war could be one step closer to ending.But as they wait to hear what will happen to them, Palestinians in Gaza must keep trying to survive.Ms. al-Jaja and her nephews moved to another neighborhood to escape the offensive in Gaza City, then fled south. They paid nearly $4,000 to a truck driver to load half their belongings — it was “pay or risk death,” the driver told them, Ms. al-Jaja said.After a 14-hour journey, they ended up back in the same charity camp they were living in last year. This time, they have no tent.Almost everyone we spoke to has been displaced from homes or shelters multiple times. Many have no home to return to.\n\nI have been displaced at least 10 times during the war. Yasser Shaban First spoke to us in October 2023I am currently living in a tent in Gaza City. We have been displaced about eight times. Wisal Abu Odeh First spoke to us in February 2024If, God forbid, an evacuation happens to my family, it would be the 10th time so far since the start of this war. Nour Barda First spoke to us in April 2024I’ve been displaced 12 times — four of them just since you last saw me. Naela al-Danaf First spoke to us in November 2024Sometimes my only wish is as simple as having a toilet of our own. Sanaa Abu Hilal First spoke to us in August 2025We’ve been left with this choice: die in Gaza City or be displaced to the south. It makes you feel helpless rage and humiliation. Montaser Bahja First spoke to us in January 2025We’ve been displaced four times. Layan al-Mohtaseb First spoke to us in January 2025We were displaced from 12 to 15 times. We fled from fear and indiscriminate bombardment. Abdul Hakim Abu Hatab First spoke to us in July 2025I was displaced 25 times from when I left northern Gaza on Oct. 14. Saed Abu Aita First spoke to us in August 2025I was displaced maybe eight times or more. I don’t remember exactly. Mohammed Aborjela First spoke to us in October 2023When you leave your home, you feel you won’t go back ever. Ehab Fasfous First spoke to us in August 2025\n\nHammam Malaka and his family in their tent in Deir al-Balah this month, without their 3-year-old daughter Seela, who was killed. Bilal Shbair for The New York Times\n\nLast October, when we wrote about Hammam Malaka and his wife, Najia Malaka, they had been separated for almost the entire war.They had gotten stuck less than 20 miles apart after Israeli troops cut off northern Gaza from southern Gaza.He was trapped in the south with Yamen, 6, and Sandy, 4. She was in the north with Seela, 3, Ashraf, the baby, and Mohammed, their newborn.When we spoke to Mr. Malaka again recently, he said they had finally managed to reunite in January, during the brief cease-fire.He told us how they found each other at what had been the border between north and south Gaza: “I switched on the flashlight of my old Nokia phone and began shouting into the dark — ‘Ashraf! Mohammed!’ — hoping she could hear me and find me more easily,” he said.Then he saw her. “I ran and hugged her and our children with everything in me,” he said.But their 3-year-old, Seela, was not there. She had been killed while they were apart.After reuniting, the family returned home to Gaza City, but then were forced to flee south again.Since Israel broke the cease-fire in March, their days have been spent in a perpetual struggle against hunger and danger, which Mr. Malaka said were like “endless waves crashing over us.”Without work, he said, he has taken the risk of grabbing supplies from passing aid trucks or lining up at aid distribution points.Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed searching for something to eat, according to aid officials.Many people we spoke to told us about hunger: suffering from malnutrition, losing significant weight or going days at a time without food, even as they tried desperately to find it.\n\nWe sometimes spend one or two days without eating anything at all. Nesreen Joudeh First spoke to us in December 2023I lost 20 kilograms during the time of famine. There were times when I just collapsed and could not carry injured people and run for 100 meters to reach the ambulance. Naseem Hassan First spoke to us in October 2023Our money is gone, all spent on the most basic food. Sabah Abu al-Roos First spoke to us in May 2025My children and I each lost at least 10 to 20 kilograms. Sami al-Astal First spoke to us in December 2023I lost about 25 kilograms. Mazen Alwahidi First spoke to us in April 2024Due to malnutrition, I now suffer from anemia and a deficiency of red blood cells. Wisal Abu Odeh First spoke to us in February 2024I’ve lost about 10 kilograms. Layan al-Mohtaseb First spoke to us in January 2025Getting chicken and meat is something fantastical. We only look at those foods online. Ehab Fasfous First spoke to us in August 2025My daughter Batoul and I both suffered from severe malnutrition. Safaa Zyadah First spoke to us in February 2024I once went through the nightmare of having a malnourished child. Shareef Kafarneh First spoke to us in March 2024As a mother, all I think about is how to save one meal for tomorrow, how to bring water without quarrels in the long lines. Yasmin al-Attar First spoke to us in March 2025Most of the people we knew are barely recognizable. They lost so much weight that we don’t recognize their faces anymore. Ramez Souri First spoke to us in December 2024\n\nAead Abu Karsh and his children, from left, Huda, Jury, Nijma and Walid. Alaa Abu Karsh\n\nAaed Abu Karsh, 35, had managed to carve out a sliver of something like normal life when we first spoke to him last November.He was managing a shawarma place in Deir al Balah, one of the few places where ordinary life went on amid the agony all around it.In January, during the cease-fire, he moved home to Gaza City.That was the last good thing that happened, he told us recently.He lost his wife’s sister to an airstrike in June and his uncle to another strike in September. He has been displaced four times since January.Since August, he has also been injured twice: once when an airstrike hit near his house, wounding him and his wife with shrapnel, and again when he was passing a Gaza City high-rise that was bombed.“The hardest thing is living with the feeling that all you can do is wait for death,” he said.He added: “Now I look at my children and wonder, will I see them alive in the months ahead? Will they be safe? And as a father, will I have the strength to protect them?”He no longer sells shawarma to eager customers. Instead, he spends his days scrounging for food, clean water and cash to pay the astronomical prices at the markets.There have been many days when all he could bring his family was bread with cheese and thyme.“Daily life is another kind of war,” he said. “This is what life has been reduced to: moving from one danger to another, trying to feed my children, trying simply to survive.”The anguish of just getting through the day came up again and again as we spoke to people about what it feels like to live through the war.\n\nAn indescribable humiliation. Ibrahim Abdulwahed First spoke to us in January 2025I don’t know when we will wake from this nightmare. Shareef Kafarneh First spoke to us in March 2024We are broken, mentally and emotionally. Hanaa al-Najjar First spoke to us in April 2024Even animals, if they were subjected to what we’ve lived through, couldn’t become accustomed to it. We are living through a catastrophe. Fatma Edaama First spoke to us in May 2024I have never cried as much in my life. Mkhaimar Abu Sada First spoke to us in November 2023The longer this war drags on, the heavier the pain grows. Yasmin al-Attar First spoke to us in March 2025We no longer have any strength. We’re so exhausted. Amir Ahmed First spoke to us in October 2023We have never lived through anything like this war. Sabah Abu al-Roos First spoke to us in May 2025I try to hold on to hope — to be the father who reassures his children, and the son who stands with his extended family. But fear and despair haunt us everywhere, as if this tragedy has no end. Amir Ahmed First spoke to us in October 2023My daughter Batoul wakes up screaming day and night from the bombings or the sound of warplanes, suffering from severe terror. Safaa Zyadah First spoke to us in February 2024We feel like chickens in a cage waiting to be slaughtered. Ehab Fasfous First spoke to us in August 2025I feel society will need 20 years to rehabilitate — this is horrific. Saed Abu Aita First spoke to us in August 2025You grow older and you can do nothing. This fills me with despair and sadness. Nizar Hammad First spoke to us in March 2024Every night, I lie awake wondering if tomorrow will bring anything better, or if it’ll just add another layer of pain. Mohammed Shubeir First spoke to us in October 2024\n\nMohamed Kilani\n\nNot everyone we tried to reach survived.Some died, or were killed, after we first spoke to them.In October 2024, when we talked to Mohamed Kilani, a lawyer in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahia, he was barely able to feed his twin 2-year-old daughters.“We have been given one option only: that is to die,” he told us at the time.Later, we saw social media posts from his family that mourned his death. When we reached his cousin, she said he had gone to look for food for his family and never returned.After he disappeared, family members saw some photos of stray dogs eating corpses in northern Gaza, the cousin said. They thought they recognized his body among them.Many people spoke about waiting — or wishing — for death.\n\nSometimes I wish we had died before witnessing all this suffering. Manal Abu Odeh First spoke to us in December 2024If I die, I want the whole world to know my dream was to live and to study. Asmaa Dwaima First spoke to us in April 2024I have nothing, no work, no food, no shelter, and no blankets. I wish I had been home when it was bombed so I could rest. Bilal Assabti First spoke to us in October 2023I wish for a missile at any moment. It would strike us all together, so that it would be better than this life. Ahmed al-Nems First spoke to us in May 2025I wished for death rather than leave my children’s graves behind. Samar Al-Muslimi First spoke to us in July 2025All I can think about is being reunited with my children under the ground. Ahmed al-Dalou First spoke to us in October 2024You just wait for the day to end with all its hardship. My dream now is martyrdom. Mariam Moeen Awwad First spoke to us in January 2025I lost all my dreams, even the ability to think about tomorrow. Death would be easier. Aseel Mutair First spoke to us in March 2024Death would be kinder than this slow, grinding suffering. Naela al-Danaf First spoke to us in November 2024I am not afraid of anything, whether I die or live. It’s all the same. Mohammed El-Sabti First spoke to us in November 2023They want to kill us, but I don’t want to die right now. I don’t want to. Asmaa Dwaima First spoke to us in April 2024\n\nNiveen Foad with four of her children, from left, Heba, Ruqaia, Awsam and Wedad. via Niveen Foad\n\nSome people we spoke to were lucky: They managed to leave, whether by paying their way out, through their foreign passports or because they were evacuated for medical treatment.But it is a tainted prize.They all have loved ones in danger back in Gaza. And for all the safety of where they are now, it is not, in the end, home.Niveen Foad is one of them. She was the only available caretaker for her 6-year-old cousin, Sarah Yusuf, who was badly injured in an airstrike. Israel allowed Ms. Foad, her three daughters and Sarah to be evacuated to Italy in February 2024.Since we first spoke to her there, two more of her children have managed to join her in Bologna.Sarah, the 6-year-old, is doing better after intensive medical treatment, and her parents and brother have also come to Italy.Ms. Foad is learning Italian and training to be an assistant chef: moving forward.Yet thoughts of what, and who, she left behind sit heavily in her mind.“I feel like I betrayed my own country by leaving, but sometimes I also think that I deserve a chance in life,” she said. And her kids deserved that chance, she said.“It’s a confusing and constant fight with myself,” she added.On the bus home from buying fish recently, she thought of her father in Gaza, who loves fish.“My tears poured down, thinking I can afford to buy food and eat, but they can barely get anything,” she said.Italy is her present, she said. Gaza, she believes, is still her future.She wants her daughters to continue their education in Italy. But for them to get married and settle in Italy — impossible, she said.“Whatever happens, I’ll end up in Gaza,” she said. “Staying in Italy is just a temporary solution.”We reached dozens of people who had been able to leave Gaza for places like Italy, Jordan and Egypt. Some, like Ms. Foad, were determined to go back. A few were less sure. Though physically safe, all are tormented by Gaza.Guilt claws at them, and worry keeps them up at night.\n\nI’m sort of depressed. Sometimes I spend a week in my room without going out. Muna Abu Holi First spoke to us in June 2024I live in constant anxiety about my children and my husband in Deir al-Balah. Yasmin Joudeh First spoke to us in November 2024I am anxious because of family still in Gaza. I think about them constantly. Fatima Abu Shaar First spoke to us in November 2024I live with deep worry and stress about my family there. Abdullah Al-Hajj First spoke to us in November 2024I think too much and cannot sleep. Nesma Abu Jiyab First spoke to us in November 2024I try to stay away from people and sit alone all the time because I am constantly thinking about my mother, my sister, and my two brothers who are still in Gaza. Ruba Abu Jibba First spoke to us in November 2024I regret leaving Gaza. Lina Gamal First spoke to us in December 2024I feel like a fish out of water. Montaser al-Saafen First spoke to us in December 2024I wish I was there with them sharing their struggle, rather than watching them on TV. Maha Ashour First spoke to us in October 2024When I remember my mother, my mental state gets much worse, but when I try not to think about it, I feel a bit better. Dareen al-Bayaa First spoke to us in November 2024If I were in Gaza it would have been easier for me, because my situation would be similar to that of the people around me, but the emptiness I live in now abroad is extremely exhausting. Mohammed al-Aloul First spoke to us in February 2024Sometimes I try to tell myself that I may never meet my family there again — that they will all die. Maryam al-Kafarneh First spoke to us in November 2024I feel the need to have my family by my side, but I do not find them. Passant al-Louh First spoke to us in November 2024\n\nMaher Ghanem and his wife, Fida, in May 2024. She died one month later, in June. via Maher Ghanem\n\nWhen we first spoke to Maher Ghanem last year, his grief was fresh.His wife had died from cancer weeks before. She had been prevented from leaving Gaza for treatment after Israeli forces seized a crucial border crossing out of the enclave.He told us when we called him again recently that he had remarried — a traditional, arranged union — so he wouldn’t have to care for his seven children alone.In September, he went to a graduation ceremony for one of his daughters, who had just nominally finished middle school. But it seemed absurd to Mr. Ghanem, he said.Realistically, his children have had almost no schooling for the last two years.His youngest son was in first grade when the war began. Now the child talks to his father about trying to make some money ferrying passengers on a donkey cart, Mr. Ghanem said.“There isn’t a school for him to attend, anyway,” he said.Mr. Ghanem, a former security officer with the Palestinian Authority, recalled attending joint Israeli-Palestinian meetings at a kibbutz in central Israel in the late 1990s.The point was to discuss how to co-exist peacefully.Those meetings, too, now seemed absurd.“There isn’t a glimmer of hope left in Gaza,” he said. “Me, and everyone else I know, just wants to get out.”Many of the people we spoke to wanted to leave Gaza.Even if the war ended somehow, few still thought there was any future left for them in Gaza.\n\nWill we still be living at the end of this, and if so, how? Suzanne Abu Daqqa First spoke to us in July 2024Displacement after displacement, famine after famine. I think this will be forever. Mohammed Al-Baradei First spoke to us in April 2024I think by the end of this war, probably all of the Gaza Strip will be wiped out. Mkhaimar Abu Sada First spoke to us in November 2023In five years, we will have to swear to people there was a city called Gaza. Mazen Alwahidi First spoke to us in April 2024The future has gone, the shop has gone, my sons’ and daughters’ future has gone, the feeling of happiness has gone. Mohammed El-Sabti First spoke to us in November 2023Gaza has no future. Muna Abu Holi First spoke to us in June 2024My children have lost their future, their education, their decent lives and their house. Ibrahim Abdulwahed First spoke to us in January 2025I dream of this war ending so I can finally sit for my high school exams — exams I’ve been preparing for over two years. Shahd Jweifel First spoke to us in November 2024My own dreams have shrunk to nothing more than a piece of bread and a safe corner. Ayah Jweifel First spoke to us in November 2024For me, hope is gone. We’re reliving the same year, the same suffering, over and over. Malak al-Haj Ahmed First spoke to us in January 2025I am staying for nothing. It isn’t going to end. We are not doing anything — we are just getting killed. Mazen Alwahidi First spoke to us in April 2024We live day by day. No one thinks about the future. Mohammed Aborjela First spoke to us in October 2023My children have no schools, no education, and no health. I wait for any moment wishing to get out of Gaza. Islam al-Astal First spoke to us in December 2023I hope to leave Gaza and live with my other two brothers abroad in safety. Abdul Hakim Abu Hatab First spoke to us in July 2025But I don’t want to die. I still want to grow up, become an architect, rebuild Gaza, become a football player in Palestine’s national team, and win the World Cup. Mohamed Abu Rteinah First spoke to us in February 2024We don’t have a present or a future. The only hope we’re living with is to be able to leave. That is the only way we will give our kids a normal life. Ehab Fasfous First spoke to us in August 2025\n\n- Share full article\n\n- Share full article",

      "content": "# EU steel tariff hike threatens 'biggest ever crisis' for UK industry\n\nThe EU has announced plans to hike tariffs on imported steel in a move the UK's steel industry has said could be \"perhaps the biggest crisis\" it has ever faced.\n\nThe commission has set out plans to cut the amount of steel that can be imported into the bloc by half - beyond which the new 50% tariffs will apply.\n\nThe EU is the UK's most important export destination for steel, worth nearly £3bn and representing 78% of steel products made in the UK for overseas markets.\n\nThe commission has come under pressure from some member states and their steel industries, which have been struggling to compete with cheap imports from countries like China and Turkey.\n\nThe EU is proposing to reduce tariff-free quotas for imports to 18.3 million tonnes a year – a 47% reduction from 2024 levels.\n\nThe new measures will come into force early next year, but will first need to be approved by the majority of EU member states and the European Parliament.\n\n\"We have global over capacity, unfair competition, state aid, and undercutting in prices and we are reacting to that\", Stéphane Séjourné, the European Commission's executive vice president for prosperity and industrial strategy.\n\n\"Eighteen thousand jobs were lost in the steel sector in 2024. That's too many, and we had to put a stop to that\", he told a news conference at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.\n\nThe announcement is another blow to the UK steel industry, after a proposed deal to eliminate tariffs on UK steel exports to the US was put on hold indefinitely in September.\n\nSeveral firms were already in dire financial straits.\n\nThe government took control of Chinese-owned plants in Scunthorpe earlier this year, while Liberty Steel plants in Rotherham and Stocksbridge collapsed into government control last month.\n\nSpeaking on his way to India on Tuesday, the prime minister said there would be \"strong support\" from the government for the British steel industry, which could be severely impacted by EU tariffs.\n\nResponding to the announcement, the director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the government \"must go all out to leverage our trading relationship with the European Union to secure UK country quotas or potentially face disaster\".\n\nThe move by the European Union is partly a response to US President Donald Trump, who sharply raised tariffs on foreign steel earlier this year, citing concern about China and has pushed other countries to take similar steps.\n\nCanada, Mexico and Brazil have also moved to increase protections for domestic steelmakers, responding to concerns about those firms losing business in the US while facing increased competition at home from shipments shifting from America.\n\nMr Stace cautioned now against the EU's measures \"redirecting millions of tonnes of steel towards the UK\", something which could be \"terminal for many of our remaining steel companies\".\n\nThe Community Union, representing UK steelworkers, called the measures an \"existential threat\" to the industry.\n\nAsked about UK concerns, European trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said at a press conference that he expected to \"fully engage\" with the UK on this issue, suggesting that a specific UK quota might be negotiated in the future.\n\nIn a statement, the Department for Business said it was \"pushing the European Commission for urgent clarification of the impact of this move on the UK\".\n\n\"It's vital we protect trade flows between the UK and EU and we will work with our closest allies to address global challenges rather than adding to our industries' woes\", Industry Minister Chris McDonald said.\n\n\"This government has shown its commitment to our steel industry by securing preferential access to the US market for our exporters, and we continue to explore stronger trade measures to protect UK steel producers from unfair behaviours.\"\n\nThe government said the industry minister will meet steel representatives on Thursday to discuss their concerns.\n\nKathleen Van Brempt, vice-chair of the European Parliament's committee on global trade, said she will advocate for the UK in the coming days, adding \"the UK for us is a very close ally\".\n\n## A big blow\n\nLiam Bates is UK managing director at Marcegaglia in Sheffield, which makes stainless steel products and exports to the EU. He said the announcement was a \"big blow\".\n\n\"It must be amongst the biggest challenges we've faced for a very long time. Now the big question is on the detail. Will there be any deal done by the UK government to soften the blow?\"\n\n\"We have no tariffs on Europe themselves, so you would expect some reciprocity on that, so that we are not treated in the same way. That's the detail we're hoping the government should work towards\", he said.\n\nIn the meantime, he said future trade with EU customers is a concern.\n\n\"We have good relationships with our customers, and we will be communicating with them, but it puts a strain on our business immediately.\"\n\n\"Our customers are in there for the long term, and so there will be a question over whether there's a long-term relationship that can still be had in the face of these quotas.\"\n\n## What tariffs has Trump announced and why?\n\n## UK hopes for 0% tariff on steel exports to US dashed",

We need a Europe that takes responsibility for its own security, makes it easier for businesses, and protects jobs. A Europe which is fairer and one that stands up for our democratic values. When the world feels too often like it is on fire, with Russian aggression against Ukraine and the horrific situation in Gaza, this Parliament is eager for Europe to step up with new and bold ideas.” “This must be Europe’s independence moment”, said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Europe must be able to take care of its own defence and security, control the technologies and energies that will fuel its economies, decide what kind of society and democracy we want to live in and be open to the world. On Ukraine, von der Leyen announced plans to turn up the pressure on Russia with a 19th package of sanctions and a faster phase-out of Russian fossil fuels. The Commission will also propose a “Qualitative Military Edge” programme to support investment in the Ukrainian armed forces, and an “Eastern Flank Watch” initiative to provide Europe with independent strategic capabilities. “Europe stands in full solidarity with Poland\", she said with regard to the “reckless and unprecedented” violation of Poland’s and Europe's airspace by Russian drones. Speaking about the war in Gaza, von der Leyen said that “man-made famine can never be a weapon of war. For the sake of the children, for the sake of humanity – this must stop.” She announced the Commission’s intention to “put our bilateral support to Israel on hold”, propose sanctions on extremist ministers and violent settlers, and impose a partial suspension of the Association Agreement on trade-related matters. Europe’s goal must be “real security for Israel and a safe present and future for all Palestinians. And that means that the hostages must be released”, she stressed. On competitiveness and the single market, President von der Leyen stressed that a digital euro and the savings and investments union will make it easier for companies and consumers alike. She announced a multi-billion euro “Scaleup Europe Fund” to make major investments in young, fast-growing companies in critical tech areas, a “Battery Booster” package to boost production in Europe, a “Quality Jobs Act” and a European anti-poverty strategy to help eradicate poverty by 2050. Regarding the trade agreement with the United States, she said: “We have the best agreement, without any doubt”, providing crucial stability and preventing a full-fledged trade war. Political group speakers Manfred Weber (EPP, DE) thanked the Commission for delivering on many fronts, from cutting red tape to strengthening EU defence and reducing illegal migration. He promised to continue supporting the Commission’s work by backing the EU-US and Mercosur trade deals, when the alternative would be a trade war. On the green deal, he argued the EU’s climate approach needs to be realistic and support technological neutrality. He also urged fellow MEPs to accelerate work on a range of EU files and to avoid ideological fights. “Where is Europe?” asked Iratxe García (S&D, ES), adding that urgency and unity cannot supersede Europe's ambition and the advancement of its own interests. García criticised the “unfair and unacceptable” trade deal with the US and announced her determination to amend it. “And where is Europe when Gaza is dying?” she added, saying the proposed suspension of cooperation with Israel comes too late. Jordan Bardella (PfE, FR) condemned President von der Leyen’s support for the Mercosur free trade deal. He criticised the EU’s proposal to lower tariffs on Chinese vehicles, as well as energy market rules that disregard France’s low-cost nuclear advantage. Bardella criticised the trade agreement with the U.S., which he said sacrifices key French industries—defence, wine, luxury goods, and pharmaceuticals—while smaller nations secure better deals. ECR Group Co-Chair Nicola Procaccini (IT) said that Europe “must strengthen our values, our economy and our allies”, adding that his group supports the tariff agreement with the US “because it is better than a trade war between allies who need each other”. He stated the Green Deal “is today too high an obstacle for European competitiveness” and applauded recent proposals on migration policy, calling for returns to be made an effective practice. Valerie Hayer (Renew, FR) warned that the EU is losing Europeans' trust because it has become too weak to defend them. She called for a more integrated, sovereign and federal EU. She warned that the EU faced an existential culture war, threatening the European way of life, its peoples' freedoms and their independence. She called for more practical action on the Democracy Shield and competitiveness, and on combating the belligerence of Russia and Israel. She concluded by calling for a convention to reform the EU. Bas Eickhout (Greens/EFA, NL) called for Europe to “stop thinking as a market and start thinking as a power”. It should show confidence, he added, demanding immediate action to address the situation in Gaza. Security also means acting on climate change, according to Eickhout, who called for investment, in European renewables and other industries to fight autocrats, but also in the European workforce, education, infrastructure and green innovation, to improve European competitiveness. Martin Schirdewan (The Left, DE) called the trade deal with the US a “total capitulation. He linked free trade policies to rising poverty, job losses, and rising costs, with billions invested in militarisation alongside “brutal cuts” in pensions and welfare. He denounced the EU’s silence on the humanitarian crisis and war crimes committed by the Israeli military in Gaza, accusing it of double standards in foreign policy and of failing to play a meaningful role in forging peace. René Aust (ESN, DE) said that, while markets are growing everywhere in the world, Europe is falling behind due to a lack of entrepreneurial freedom. He also blamed migration policy for increased violence, criminal gangs, drugs, and issues with the safety of women in Europe.

      "content": "# Asian shares are mostly lower after US stocks retreat\n\nShares are mostly lower in Asia after Wall Street snapped a long streak of records\n\nShares were mostly lower in Asia on Wednesday after U.S. stocks sank to their first loss in eight days, losing momentum after the price of gold topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time.\n\nThe price of gold was up $25.40 at $4,029.60 an ounce. U.S. futures and oil prices also advanced.\n\nThe Japanese yen fell sharply against the dollar on expectations that Sanae Takaichi, the conservative lawmaker likely to become the next prime minister, will push to keep interest rates low.\n\nThe dollar rose to 152.53 yen from 151.90 yen, while the euro slipped to $1.1621 from $1.1659.\n\nTokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% higher to 48,002.18.\n\nTakaichi, who the ruling Liberal Democrats chose as their leader last weekend, is expected to increase spending and to advocate for easier credit, possibly slowing efforts by the Bank of Japan to raise its key interest rate. It has remained near zero for years, even as inflation has exceeded its target of about 2%, outpacing wage increases.\n\n“While the economic case for tighter monetary policy remains intact, we suspect that the Bank of Japan will use the pressure by Japan’s incoming government as an opportunity to delay rate hikes until January,” Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary.\n\nLawmakers in Japan's lower house of parliament are due to elect a successor to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later this month. The Liberal Democrats hold the most seats despite not having an outright majority, so Takaishi is expected to become the country's first female prime minister.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.9% to 26,719.68 and the S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower to 8,945.10.\n\nMarkets in mainland China and South Korea were closed for holidays.\n\nIn Taiwan, the Taiex lost 1%.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.4% from its all-time high, closing at 6,714.59. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% to 46,602.98, and the Nasdaq composite gave up 0.7% to 22,788.36.\n\n## Government shutdown updates: IRS to furlough nearly half its staff\n\n- Oct 8, 4:19 PM\n\n## Central witness undermines case against Comey, prosecutors concluded: Sources\n\n- Oct 8, 10:36 AM\n\n## Sniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHS\n\n- Sep 24, 6:39 PM\n\nTesla was the heaviest weight on the market and dropped 4.4% after unveiling cheaper versions of two of its electric car models. The stock gave back most of its leap from the prior day, when speculation and hype built after Tesla hinted at a coming product announcement.\n\nOracle also helped drag the market lower. It fell 2.5% after a news report suggested it’s making thin profit margins on a key line of business related to artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nU.S. shares have rushed higher in recent months on hopes that the economy will remain resilient and that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates.\n\nThe rapid rise of artificial intelligence has helped fan buying enthusiasm, but also is raising worries that share prices may have shot too high.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dell climbed 3.5% after executives talked up the company’s opportunity for growth because of AI at an investment conference. Advanced Micro Devices rallied 3.8% to add to its surge from Monday, when it announced a deal where OpenAI will use its chips to power AI infrastructure. IBM rose 1.5% after announcing a partnership that will integrate Anthropic’s Claude AI chatbot into some of its software products.\n\nMuch is riding on expectations that the AI investment boom will pay off by making the global economy more productive and driving more growth. Without that increased efficiency, inflation could push higher due to upward pressure coming from the mountains of debt that the U.S. and other governments worldwide are building.\n\nInvestors have traditionally seen gold as a hedge against high inflation. Its price has soared more than 50% this year because of governments’ huge debt loads, political uncertainties and anticipation that the Fed will cut interest rates.\n\nAlso early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 52 cents at $62.25 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 50 cents to $65.95 per barrel.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.\n\n## Sponsored Content by Taboola\n\n## Government shutdown updates: IRS to furlough nearly half its staff\n\n- Oct 8, 4:19 PM\n\n## Sniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHS\n\n- Sep 24, 6:39 PM\n\n## Central witness undermines case against Comey, prosecutors concluded: Sources\n\n- Oct 8, 10:36 AM\n\n## Mark Sanchez charged with felony due to victim's 'incredibly significant injuries'\n\n- Oct 6, 6:06 PM\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",
